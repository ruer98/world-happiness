# world-happiness

This project served a two-fold purpose for me. The World Happiness Data Set seemed to be the best data to apply both data analysis skills and behavioral economics.

### Questions Explored
- Which are the happiest and least happy countries and regions in the world?
- Is happiness affected by region?
- Did the happiness score change significantly from 2015 to 2017?
- **Is the World Happiness Report an accurate measure true happiness?***
