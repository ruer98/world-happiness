# world-happiness
This project served a two-fold purpose for me. The World Happiness Data Set seemed to be the best data to apply both data analysis skills and behavioral economics.

### About the Data
World Happiness Report Data from 2015-2017. Taken from: https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/

Each country's "Happiness Score" is calculated by summing the seven other variables in the table:

- Economy: GDP per Capita
- Family: Social Support
- Health: Life Expectancy
- Freedom: Freedom to Make Life Choices
- Trust: perceived corruption
- Generosity: perceptions of generosity
- Dystopia: Each country is compared to "Dystopia" which is a hypothetical nation with the lowest value for each of - the 6 factors. The residual error between "Dystopia" and the country is used as a benchmark for regression

### Questions Explored
- Which are the happiest and least happy countries and regions in the world?
- Is happiness affected by region?
- Did the happiness score change significantly from 2015 to 2017?
- **Is the World Happiness Report an accurate measure true happiness?***
